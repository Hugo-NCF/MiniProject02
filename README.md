## Page Sections

### Navbar
A fixed navigation bar at the top of the page that stays visible while scrolling. It contains the JHA Cleats logo, navigation links (Home, Shop, About Us), and icons for a shopping cart and user profile. 

### Banner
The hero section that greets visitors with a large heading and a short description of the brand. It uses a two-column grid layout with text on the left and an action image on the right. On mobile, the layout switches to a single column with the image on top.

### Product Display
The main section of the site, displaying 18 cleats organized into three brand categories: Adidas, Nike, and Mizuno. Each category has its own title and a grid of product cards. Every card shows the product image, name, price, and an "Add to Cart" button. The cards use a glassmorphic design with a semi-transparent background and scale up on hover to draw attention.

### Newsletter
A call-to-action section inviting visitors to subscribe via email. It features a background image with an email input field and a subscribe button, encouraging users to stay connected with the brand.

### Footer
The bottom section of the page containing the JHA Cleats logo, two columns of navigation links (Home, About Us, FAQ, Privacy Policy, etc.), social media icons (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube), and a copyright notice. On mobile, everything stacks into a single centered column.

## Design Principles

- **Simplicity**: Clean layout focused on one product category with no unnecessary clutter.
- **Consistency**: Uniform card design, color scheme, and spacing across all sections.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Large headings guide the eye, followed by category titles, then product details.
- **Typography**: Serif and sans-serif font pairing creates contrast between headings and body text.
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries adapt the layout for screens under 768px.
- **Color Theory**: Dark background with a bright green accent (#A6E22E) provides strong contrast and brand identity.

## Brand Color

- HEX: #A6E22E
